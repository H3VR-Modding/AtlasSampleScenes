# AtlasSampleScenes
This repo holds the editor scripts for Atlas in MeatKit, as well as the sample scenes.

# Usage
If you're looking to make maps, you should download and import the latest release from the GitHub page into your MeatKit project.

# Development
If you are wanting to contribute to the sample scenes or editor scripts for Atlas, do the following
to setup an environment inside an existing MeatKit project. Make sure you don't already have Atlas imported.

1. Compile the [Atlas plugin from source](https://github.com/H3VR-Modding/Atlas), using the 'Editor' configuration. Then import the resulting DLL into your MeatKit project.
2. Clone this repo into the `Assets/Packages/Atlas/` directory of your project using the following commands:
```
cd Assets/Packages
git clone https://github.com/H3VR-Modding/AtlasSampleScenes Atlas
```
3. Done! You're free to make your changes now.
